## HEY! no buly plz
In actual talks, use your common sense and don't be an as***le. And in case you were planning on doing that, internet points can't buy you a car. Programming can.

### Remember these 3 things:

- <b>Use common sense.</b> If it isn't logical, don't say it.
- <b>Keep everyone safe.</b> Don't talk about others or your own personal info.
- <b>Keep tweaking.</b> Your code will work at some point.

thankz
